# Groovy NullPointerException in Implicit Type Conversion

This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy related to null values and implicit type conversions.  Groovy's dynamic typing, while offering flexibility, can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with potentially null values. 

The `bug.groovy` file contains a simple function that demonstrates the issue. The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version. 

The issue is that Groovy's implicit type conversion may lead to unexpected results without explicit null handling.
